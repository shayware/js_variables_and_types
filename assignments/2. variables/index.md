```

## Basic Operations

Mathematical Operations:

Solve this using mathematical operations. (+, -, *, / , etc)

```js
var amount = 2080;
// Define a new variable and store the value that is 80 less then the value of amount.

var lessAmount = amount - 80;


// Define a new variable and store the value that is 200 more then the value of amount.

var moreAmount = amount + 200;


// Define a new variable and store the value that is 4 times the value of amount.

var multipleAmount = amount*4;


// Define a new variable and store the reminder when the value of amount is  divided by 21.

var dividedAmount = amount % 21;

```

Logical Operation:

Solve this using logical operations. (<, >, &&, ||)

```js
var johnAge = 45;
var markAge = 35;

// Check who is older eithe John or Mark

var older = (johnAge>markAge) ? alert("John is older"): alert("mark is older");

// Check who is younger

var yonger = (johnAge>markAge) ? alert("Mark is yonger"): alert("John is yonger");


// Check if their age is equal

var equal = (johnAge==markAge) ? alert("Mark is yonger"): alert("John is yonger");


// Create a new variable and assign the age of john to new variable.

var johnCopy = johnAge;

// Check if john is equal to or greater then mark.

var isEqual = (johnAge==markAge) ? alert("Mark and john age are equal"): (johnAge>markAge)?alert("John is elder than mark"):alert("John is yonger than mark");

// Check if john is less then or equal to mark.

var isEqual2 = (johnAge==markAge) ? alert("Mark and john age are equal"): (johnAge>markAge)?alert("John is more than mark"):alert("mark is more than mark");


// Calculate the average age of john and mark and assign to a new variable.
var avgAge = (johnAge + markAge)/2;
